Read on to learn more, and if you have questions, feel free to reach our Designated Privacy Contact, Chief Privacy and Security Officer, Nicholas Chepesiuk [email protected] . You can download a copy of this privacy policy here. Our commitment OnCall Health will never collect, use or disclose personal or personal health information without consent of the individual it relates to. OnCall Health safeguards personal and personal health information on the basis of risk assessments and industry standards regarding physical security, technological security and administrative policies and processes, as explained further below. OnCall Health complies with all applicable personal health information legislation where it operates. What we collect From health care providers: We collect name, business contact information, specialization, and college registration number (if applicable). From patients: When consulting their own health care provider registered with OnCall Health, we collect: \u2022 Name (or initials) and email of the patient \u2022 Date and time of the appointment \u2022 Any written instructions by the provider added to the \u201cnotes for patient\u201d after the appointment \u2022 Files attached by the provider or patient during or after the appointment inside the platform, usually as PDF or word documents. \u2022 In some cases, results of interactive forms and assessments that are assigned and completed through the system. How we protect it OnCall Health protects personal and personal health information through integrated physical, technological and administrative safeguards: Physical safeguards: OnCall Health premises are divided into secure areas where electronic equipment and personal and personal health information cannot be accessed without authorization. Access is controlled by a code and monitored in a manner that keeps all personal and personal health information secure from unauthorized access. OnCall Health technological equipment does not include portables that leave the premises. All necessary backups are safely locked. OnCall Health does not keep personal or personal health information on paper. Technological safeguards: OnCall Health stores all personal and personal health information in Northern Virginia, with Amazon Web Services Secure Cloud (AWS). AWS is certified as compliant with ISO Standard 27018 Code of Practice for personal identifiable information (PII) protection in public clouds acting as PII processors. In addition to the independent certification process under ISO 27018, the Standard also includes the right to audit AWS for compliance. The secure video and/or text consultation is encrypted with the AES cipher using 256-bit keys. Here are the details on our encryption: \u2022 The basic voice, video, and text traffic are converted into cipher, a form which cannot be understood by anyone except authorized parties. \u2022 The conversion is done with random keys that change from the beginning to the end of the conversation to make it even more secure. \u2022 The keys last a short period of time and are neither stored nor persistent anywhere. OnCall Health destroys or anonymizes all personal and personal health information when it is no longer necessary to deliver service. OnCall Health employees can only gain technological access to personal information or personal health information collected by OnCall Health: \u2022 With a robust password, based on required elements. \u2022 Upon authorization, granted strictly on a need-to-know basis, defined according to job requirements. Access is monitored through technological audit trails. Audit trails are regularly reviewed to ensure compliance. Administrative measures OnCall Health has appointed a Designated Privacy Contact, mentioned above, who acts as Chief Privacy and Security Officer (CPSO) responsible for information system monitoring and information security policy and procedure management. The CPSO is responsible for compliance with OnCall Health\u2019s privacy programme including, \u2022 Undertaking threat and risk assessments on a regular basis and as systems are approved. \u2022 Adopting policies and procedures on the basis of threat and risk assessments to mitigate all identified risks, updated as necessary. OnCall Health users may access their personal information by accessing their account and, should they require assistance, by contacting our CPSO. OnCall Health closes accounts immediately upon request and destroys or anonymizes all personal information. OnCall Health completes background checks on all employees before starting employment. As soon as employment starts, OnCall Health trains, supports and supervises all employees on its Privacy Policy and procedures. Contractors are held to the same high level of protection of personal and personal health information as OnCall Health through contractual agreements, including audits, based on OnCall Health Privacy Policy and procedures. OnCall Health senior management receives regular reports on privacy compliance and, in turn, reports to the Board for oversight. OnCall Health is regularly audited by a third party to ensure we are meeting our privacy obligations. This is part of a process for OnCall Health to reassess all policies and procedures on an ongoing basis to ensure that legal requirements are met and personal and personal health information is highly secure. How we use it OnCall Health will never use personal or personal health information for other purposes than why it is provided with consent and necessary to deliver service. OnCall Health will never rent or sell the personal information or personal health information it collects. OnCall Health will never disclose personal or personal health information, except as required by law and upon demonstrated lawful authority. Should OnCall Health conduct market or product research, it would never use personal nor personal health information; rather, it would fully anonymize information which means to render it unlikely to be traced back to an individual. Should OnCall Health offer users the opportunity to receive relevant information on products or services, or promotions, OnCall Health will seek explicit consent to exercise that option. Breach response Experience tells us that there is no total guarantee against data breaches. Damage can be mitigated, however, and OnCall Health has taken all reasonable measures to prevent a breach, as described above. In the event of a breach, OnCall Health would immediately mitigate its impact by: \u2022 Notifying users at the first reasonable opportunity, namely as soon as we identify the breach, \u2022 Applying remedial measures immediately. Ensuring patients\u2019 meaningful consent To ensure OnCall Health patients\u2019 meaningful consent, OnCall Health provides relevant information in this Privacy Policy, as well as through the availability of our Designated Privacy Contact, [email protected] and subjects use of OnCall Health secure video consultation to the following patient consent form. To proceed with registration for OnCall Health secure video consultations, a patient must complete this consent form. OnCall Health Secure Consultation Patient Consent Form I agree to OnCall Health secure video or text consultation with a health care provider on the basis of the following information: OnCall Health will collect my name, the name and contact information of the health care provider, including specialization, as well as the time of appointment.

OnCall Health does not use my personal or personal health information without my consent except as necessary to provide its service. OnCall will never rent or sell my personal and personal health information. OnCall will never disclose my personal information except as required by law and upon demonstration of lawful authority. OnCall will close my account immediately upon request and destroy or anonymize all personal information.",

        "content": "MiniJournal \u2014 James Kelly New Page home Menu James Kelly New Page home MiniJournal is an iOS / iPadOS app for capturing everyday stuff. It main focuses are simplicity, longevity - meaning building a body of entries that may outlast the app or your device - and privacy. With those goals in mind, I settled on these main features: A very simple interface that puts the action of adding new entries top and centre. A calendar to show days on which you\u2019ve added entries. Export of all diary entries in JSON format. Entries are saved only as text, with a latitude, longitude, and date. No rich data is saved, such as images, videos, links, etc. Photos from your photo library are shown along side entries for a given day. Photos are not stored in your diary. Syncing across iCloud so you can see your entries on all your devices. The ability to search entries for keywords. As well as core features, there a are a couple of nice-to-haves: Dozens of different coloured icons. Dozens of different app themes. The basic idea Coming across one of your an old note books or diaries from years ago can be an eye opening experience, especially if you have a poor memory like I do. I am not a diary person really, but I am a notebook person. I buy notebooks and do nothing with them because I don\u2019t want to ruin them. Maybe once every few years I\u2019ll write down some idle thoughts in them and eventually the notebook will be abandoned in a drawer somewhere. When I come across them years later I\u2019m frequently stunned by how much of the routine of my life at that time has faded from active memory. None if it is really important - it\u2019s mostly I went here and did this, then went there and did another thing . It\u2019s not interesting to anyone else. But reading an old diary is like digging up old pieces of your own back story you might have, if not forgotten, had no reason to recall. Diary Apps tho\u2026 But I don\u2019t really want a diary app. I don\u2019t want to use an app that stores photos and videos and rich text with tagging. Because after 5 years that app will become a service and will add tiers of features and membership pricing. It\u2019ll become Evernote. And a couple of years after that it\u2019ll shutter, probably taking my entires with it. If I\u2019m lucky I can export them to another services, maybe. Or I\u2019ll die and my account with that service will languish until it\u2019s eventually deleted. What I really want is the app equivalent of a shoebox full of bits of paper, with text and a date written on them. I set out to make this with MiniJournal. The shoebox metaphor let me settle on the core functionality of the app, which would be to Store plain text, a latitude & longitude, and a date. Have no servers or accounts. So store entries locally on device, and use iCloud if possible to let the app work across devices. Allow easy export, in a format that isn\u2019t tied specifically to the implementation of the app. I settled on exporting as JSON for this. While vaguely human readable, it\u2019s quite simple to write scripts to manipulate the entries into some other format in the future. No rich data saved along side entries. As much as possible, use the device\u2019s capabilities to surface related media for an entry\u2019s date/time. Photos, for example, would not be saved in diary. They would be just shown from the device photo library. Photo libraries are probably one of our most treasured possessions, so I reasoned it could be relied on to persist at least as long as your journal does. Back to Top",

        "content": "Violence Intervention Program Community Mental Health Center Privacy Policy Violence Intervention Program Community Mental Health Center Privacy Policy OnCall Health built the Violence Intervention Program Community Mental Health Center app and it is intended for use as is. Privacy Policy OnCall Health allows health care providers to enhance their service with secure video consultations, and patients to consult health care providers from the privacy and convenience of the location they choose. This means personal information and personal health information is collected by OnCall Health. This information is highly sensitive and protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and all equivalent personal health information protection legislation throughout the United States. OnCall Health is committed to safeguard it at the corresponding level. This Policy describes the physical, technological and administrative measures we implement to safeguard personal and personal health information. We comply with privacy law and we honour the trust of our users by taking every necessary measure to pro-tect personal and personal health information. By law, personal information is information that relates to an identifiable individual, to the exclusion of business contact information (name, title, work address, work phone number or work email address). Personal health information includes information that relates to an identifiable individual\u2019s health, physical or mental, health history including family, or medical treatment. If we update this Privacy Policy, we will notify you. Read on to learn more, and if you have questions, feel free to reach our Designated Privacy Contact, Chief Privacy and Security Officer, Nicholas Chepesiuk [email protected] . You can download a copy of this privacy policy here. Our commitment OnCall Health will never collect, use or disclose personal or personal health information without consent of the individual it relates to. OnCall Health safeguards personal and personal health information on the basis of risk assessments and industry standards regarding physical security, technological security and administrative policies and processes, as explained further below. OnCall Health complies with all applicable personal health information legislation where it operates. What we collect From health care providers: We collect name, business contact information, specialization, and college registration number (if applicable). From patients: When consulting their own health care provider registered with OnCall Health, we collect: \u2022 Name (or initials) and email of the patient \u2022 Date and time of the appointment \u2022 Any written instructions by the provider added to the \u201cnotes for patient\u201d after the appointment \u2022 Files attached by the provider or patient during or after the appointment inside the platform, usually as PDF or word documents. \u2022 In some cases, results of interactive forms and assessments that are assigned and completed through the system. How we protect it OnCall Health protects personal and personal health information through integrated physical, technological and administrative safeguards: Physical safeguards: OnCall Health premises are divided into secure areas where electronic equipment and personal and personal health information cannot be accessed without authorization. Access is controlled by a code and monitored in a manner that keeps all personal and personal health information secure from unauthorized access. OnCall Health technological equipment does not include portables that leave the premises. All necessary backups are safely locked. OnCall Health does not keep personal or personal health information on paper. Technological safeguards: OnCall Health stores all personal and personal health information in Northern Virginia, with Amazon Web Services Secure Cloud (AWS). AWS is certified as compliant with ISO Standard 27018 Code of Practice for personal identifiable information (PII) protection in public clouds acting as PII processors. In addition to the independent certification process under ISO 27018, the Standard also includes the right to audit AWS for compliance. The secure video and/or text consultation is encrypted with the AES cipher using 256-bit keys. Here are the details on our encryption: \u2022 The basic voice, video, and text traffic are converted into cipher, a form which cannot be understood by anyone except authorized parties. \u2022 The conversion is done with random keys that change from the beginning to the end of the conversation to make it even more secure. \u2022 The keys last a short period of time and are neither stored nor persistent anywhere. OnCall Health destroys or anonymizes all personal and personal health information when it is no longer necessary to deliver service. OnCall Health employees can only gain technological access to personal information or personal health information collected by OnCall Health: \u2022 With a robust password, based on required elements. \u2022 Upon authorization, granted strictly on a need-to-know basis, defined according to job requirements. Access is monitored through technological audit trails. Audit trails are regularly reviewed to ensure compliance. Administrative measures OnCall Health has appointed a Designated Privacy Contact, mentioned above, who acts as Chief Privacy and Security Officer (CPSO) responsible for information system monitoring and information security policy and procedure management. The CPSO is responsible for compliance with OnCall Health\u2019s privacy programme including, \u2022 Undertaking threat and risk assessments on a regular basis and as systems are approved. \u2022 Adopting policies and procedures on the basis of threat and risk assessments to mitigate all identified risks, updated as necessary. OnCall Health users may access their personal information by accessing their account and, should they require assistance, by contacting our CPSO. OnCall Health closes accounts immediately upon request and destroys or anonymizes all personal information. OnCall Health completes background checks on all employees before starting employment. As soon as employment starts, OnCall Health trains, supports and supervises all employees on its Privacy Policy and procedures. Contractors are held to the same high level of protection of personal and personal health information as OnCall Health through contractual agreements, including audits, based on OnCall Health Privacy Policy and procedures. OnCall Health senior management receives regular reports on privacy compliance and, in turn, reports to the Board for oversight. OnCall Health is regularly audited by a third party to ensure we are meeting our privacy obligations. This is part of a process for OnCall Health to reassess all policies and procedures on an ongoing basis to ensure that legal requirements are met and personal and personal health information is highly secure. How we use it OnCall Health will never use personal or personal health information for other purposes than why it is provided with consent and necessary to deliver service. OnCall Health will never rent or sell the personal information or personal health information it collects. OnCall Health will never disclose personal or personal health information, except as required by law and upon demonstrated lawful authority. Should OnCall Health conduct market or product research, it would never use personal nor personal health information; rather, it would fully anonymize information which means to render it unlikely to be traced back to an individual. Should OnCall Health offer users the opportunity to receive relevant information on products or services, or promotions, OnCall Health will seek explicit consent to exercise that option. Breach response Experience tells us that there is no total guarantee against data breaches. Damage can be mitigated, however, and OnCall Health has taken all reasonable measures to prevent a breach, as described above. In the event of a breach, OnCall Health would immediately mitigate its impact by: \u2022 Notifying users at the first reasonable opportunity, namely as soon as we identify the breach, \u2022 Applying remedial measures immediately. Ensuring patients\u2019 meaningful consent To ensure OnCall Health patients\u2019 meaningful consent, OnCall Health provides relevant information in this Privacy Policy, as well as through the availability of our Designated Privacy Contact, [email protected] and subjects use of OnCall Health secure video consultation to the following patient consent form. To proceed with registration for OnCall Health secure video consultations, a patient must complete this consent form. OnCall Health Secure Consultation Patient Consent Form I agree to OnCall Health secure video or text consultation with a health care provider on the basis of the following information: OnCall Health will collect my name, the name and contact information of the health care provider, including specialization, as well as the time of appointment.

OnCall Health does not use my personal or personal health information without my consent except as necessary to provide its service. OnCall will never rent or sell my personal and personal health information. OnCall will never disclose my personal information except as required by law and upon demonstration of lawful authority. OnCall will close my account immediately upon request and destroy or anonymize all personal information.",

This privacy policy explains how the Trust uses your \u201cpersonal data\u201d when you use the \u201cMind Meds App\u201d . We\u2019ve tried to make our privacy policy simple, clear and easy to read. You can click on the headings below to find out more about how we handle your information. Who we are, how to contact us and our Data Protection Officer We are South West London and St George`s Mental Health NHS Trust . You can find out more about us on our website ( http://www.swlstg.nhs.uk ) by clicking \u2018about us\u2019, and our contact details are Springfield University Hospital, 61 Glenburnie Rd, London SW17 7DJ . You can also contact us via social media. The person responsible for monitoring the \u201cMind Meds App\u2019 data protection compliance is the Trust Information Governance Manager and can be contacted via the freedom of information team foi@swlstg.nhs.uk We are registered as a \u2018data controller\u2019 with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, under registration number Z7616349 You can view our registration by clicking here: https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/what-we-do/register-of-fee-payers/ What personal data do we hold (i) Any Information you enter into the App is not transmitted from the App to any server unless you request this by using the \u201cSend Report\u201d (via email) option. When you use this function the information is transmitted over the open internet without encryption (using \u2018SMTP\u2019) and sent to you and your health professional but not the Trust. There is a small risk that this information might be intercepted because of problems with your device, the recipients\u2019 email systems or the connection between the App and the recipients\u2019 email systems. To minimise this risk you should keep your anti-virus/spyware software up to date on all devices you use and you should ask your health professional to do the same. Therefore any personal data we may hold is only that data which you provide us by email originating from use of the Minds Meds App. (ii) The app is assigned a unique number when installed on your device which enables the NHS Trust to monitor usage. Usage data sent from the app to a server does not include your personal data but might include usage data relating to your device as well as the app itself, for example the operating system version used on your phone (e.g. iOS7). No link is made between your personal data and this information about your device and usage of the app. We need to use this data in order for the app to work and to trouble-shoot problems. Usage data is used by the NHS Trust to improve the design, functionality and performance of the app and is stored in accordance with Data Protection law. The NHS Trust will not have access through this route to your clinical or other personal data that you input into the App. (iii) If you change your device\u2019s operating system (e.g. \u2018jail-break\u2019 your device) then your Personal Data may be at risk and to the extent permissible by law the liability provisions above will apply to any loss you may suffer. (iv) We have measures in place to keep your information safe but it is important that you also play your part - visit the government's \u2018Get Safe Online\u2019 website for advice on how to do this ( www.getsafeonline.org ). What we do with your personal data Normally, your data is only stored on your advice and we will not be holding, storing or sharing any of your personal data unless you email your information through the send report function as described above. If you do so, the information you send will then be handled in accordance with the Trust\u2019s general privacy policy and records retention arrangements, which are explained Privacy and confidentiality at SWLSTG . If you have any questions or concerns about how personal data is handled Please contact us in the first instance using the details above. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office which is the UK\u2019s regulator for data protection law, can be contacted through www.ico.org.uk Policy Updates We may make changes from time to time and you should check the App web site regularly to keep up-to-date or visit the App Store .

Ich erlange auch Daten dar\u00fcber, welches Endger\u00e4t (Computer, Smartphone, Tablet, etc.) Du benutzt, welchen Browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.) Du verwendest und den Zeitpunkt des Zugriffs auf die Webseite, den sog. Referrer und \u00fcbertragene Datenmengen. Diese Daten k\u00f6nnen von mir nicht dazu verwendet werden, den einzelnen Nutzer zu identifizieren. Sie werden nicht in Logfiles, sondern nur aggregiert gespeichert und dienen statistischen Auswertungen. Solche Analysen helfen mir dabei, meine Webseiten attraktiver zu gestalten und deren Leistung bzw. Inhalte gegebenenfalls zu verbessern. Meine Webseiten setzen keine Cookies. F\u00fcr den Betrieb der Webseite habe ich einen Webhoster beauftragt. Die \u00dcbertragung von Daten an diesen Webhoster findet nur aufgrund gesetzlicher Vorschriften oder im Rahmen einer Auftragsverarbeitung statt. 2.

Au\u00dferdem erlange ich Daten dar\u00fcber, welches Ger\u00e4t (iPhone, iPad, Android-Smartphone, etc.) du verwendest, und wie lange du welche Aktionen innerhalb der App durchf\u00fchrst (z.B. welches Level in einem Spiel du spielst und deinen Punktestand). Anhand der IP-Adresse kann ich deinen ungef\u00e4hren Standort einsch\u00e4tzen (z.B. in welcher Metropolregion du dich befindest). Diese Daten werden anonymisiert (IP-Adressen werden nicht gespeichert), und k\u00f6nnen somit nicht dazu verwendet werden, den einzelnen Nutzer zu identifizieren (Ausnahmen s. Absatz 2.2). Sie dienen statistischen Auswertungen. Solche Analysen helfen mir dabei, meine Apps attraktiver zu gestalten und deren Leistung bzw. Inhalte gegebenenfalls zu verbessern. Zum Beispiel kann ich sicherstellen, dass Level in einem Spiel nicht zu leicht oder zu schwer sind, entscheiden welche Funktionen Nutzer besonders gerne verwenden und noch erweitert werden k\u00f6nnen, oder sehen an welchen Stellen meine Apps Fehler enthalten.

Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights. 8.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are: (a) the right to access; (b) the right to rectification; (c) the right to erasure; (d) the right to restrict processing; (e) the right to object to processing; (f) the right to data portability; (g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and (h) the right to withdraw consent. 8.3 You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. 8.4 You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed. 8.5 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. 8.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection.

However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest. 8.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. 8.8 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose. 8.9 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. 8.10 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is: (a) consent; or (b) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. 8.11 If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. 8.12 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal. 8.13 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us. 9.

February 2024 Introduction The Monsenso Solution is designed to support the treatment of individuals with a mental disorder by collecting health-related data and sharing it with their clinician. As the purpose of the Monsenso Solution is to collect and share personal data of its users, below we have described how we process such personal data. As a general rule we process personal data of our users to facilitate the Monsenso Solution, and out intent is to ensure that data minimisation principles are met. Please also be aware that Monsenso only collects and stores personal data and Monsenso will not make any analyses of the personal data collected by the Monsenso Solution. It is your responsibility how you use the Solution and what personal data you want to share with third parties. PRIVACY NOTICE The protection and confidentiality of your personal information is important and Monsenso A/S (\"Monsenso\", \"we\" and \"us\") is determined to protect it. Monsenso has, therefore, drafted this document in order to be perfectly clear about our policy on collecting, using and protecting personal data and other information managed by the Monsenso Solution. If you do not find the answer to your questions in this document, feel free to contact us though this email: support@monsenso.com. Monsenso A/S is a Danish company with registered offices located at: Rosen\u00f8rns All\u00e9 31, 2. , DK-1970 Frederiksberg, Denmark, and is represented by Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Thomas Lethenborg. The Monsenso Solution is designed to enable the Individual (usually a patient in a clinic), the Carer (any person supporting the Individual, for instance relatives or a social worker) and the Care Provider (any professional provider, for instance a clinician or therapist) to share information relating to the treatment and managing of mental wellness of the individual. The Monsenso Solution may be used in three scenarios. In all three scenarios Monsenso is merely making the Solution available to its users. \u2018CLINIC SCENARIO\u2019 In this scenario, the Clinic buys a license to the Solution and invites the Individual, Carer and Care Provider to use the Solution. All users are given access to the Solution by the Clinic. When you as Individual, Care Provider and Carer have been given access to the Monsenso Solution in the Clinic Scenario, the Clinic determines the purposes and means of the processing of your Personal Data, i.e. the Clinic acts as a data controller. When submitting your personal data using Monsenso Solution, Monsenso is obligated to follow the instructions provided by your Clinic (the data controller) and shall process your personal data only for the purposes of providing you with the Monsenso Solution, i.e. Monsenso acts as a data processor. Monsenso have signed a data processing agreement with the Clinic complying with the requirements in the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (\u201cGDPR\u201d)). If you want to know more about how the Clinic processes your personal data, please contact the clinic. In the Clinic Scenario, Monsenso will not use any Personal Data uploaded to or generated by the Solution for its own means and purposes unless set out in this Privacy Policy. \u2018CLINICAL STUDY SCENARIO\u2019 In this scenario, the sponsor of a clinical study buys a license to the Solution, which is used in the clinical study.

LINKS TO OTHER SERVICES This Privacy Policy applies only to the Monsenso Solution.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

If, however, you wish to use some of the features offered in the Mobile Application, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish content, make a purchase, or fill any forms in the Mobile Application.

We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children\u2019s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission. Use and processing of collected information We act as a data controller and a data processor in terms of the GDPR when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data processor. Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Mobile Application and Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information and we comply with data controllers\u2019 obligations set forth in the GDPR. We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller in terms of the GDPR. In order to make the Mobile Application and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes: Create and manage user accounts Run and operate the Mobile Application and Services Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Mobile Application and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. We rely on the following legal bases as defined in the GDPR upon which we collect and process your Personal Information: Compliance with the law and legal obligations Our own legitimate interests Personal Information is already publicly available Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases above. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. Payment processing In case of Services requiring payment, you may need to provide your credit card details or other payment account information, which will be used solely for processing payments. We use third-party payment processors (\u201cPayment Processors\u201d) to assist us in processing your payment information securely. Payment Processors adhere to the latest security standards as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures, and the Mobile Application and Services are also in compliance with strict vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an environment as possible for Users. We will share payment data with the Payment Processors only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing your payments, refunding such payments, and dealing with complaints and queries related to such payments and refunds. Please note that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal Information from you, which allows them to process your payments (e.g., your email address, address, credit card details, and bank account number) and handle all the steps in the payment process through their systems, including data collection and data processing. The Payment Processors\u2019 use of your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy. We suggest that you review their respective privacy policies. Managing information You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you.

If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so on the settings page of your account in the Mobile Application or simply by contacting us.

We will not share any personally identifiable information with third parties and will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties. Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes.

To review your Advertising Choices in greater detail, please see Section 3.3 of this Privacy Policy. For additional information and disclosures about the Program, please see the Mobile Messaging Terms of Service applicable to you. 2.0 Transparency/Notice\u2013What Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from external sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Otsuka and the requirements of applicable law. We endeavor to collect information only relevant for the purposes of processing. Below are the legal bases and some of the ways we collect information and how we use it. 2.1 Individuals Otsuka collects Personal Information regarding its customers, visitors and guests including website visitors, patients or clinical trial subjects, healthcare providers, employees, workers or job applicants (collectively \"Individuals\"). 2.2 Information Otsuka Collects The data we collect from or about Individuals include information that may be deemed Personal Information (alone or in combination with other Information), such as name, address, age, birth date, phone number, email address, user name, government identification, and payment information. In addition, if you participate in certain programs or services, we may collect information regarding your medications, medical history and other healthcare-related information, including, without limitation, Protected Health Information (collectively, \"Health Information\"), from you or others. For example, we may indirectly collect information about your health condition, diagnosis, and treatment from your healthcare professional, but only where your healthcare professional has obtained your consent to disclose that information to us, as required by law. Any Health Information that is tied to an Individual's Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information, provided that any Protected Health Information will be protected in accordance with the requirements of HIPAA, if applicable. For job applicants, we collect Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy in conjunction with your application, including: name, address, e-mail address, and other contact information; work authorization status, CV/resume, previous work experience and education information; information related to your knowledge and skills; and, other information that you elect to provide. This information is used to process your application. For employees, we collect Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy in conjunction with your employment with Otsuka, including: name, address, e-mail address, other contact information, bank account information, benefits information, and other work-related data. This information is used in connection with your employment. 2.3 How Otsuka Collects Personal Information Some of the ways that Otsuka may collect your Personal Information include: Otsuka may collect Personal Information from you through various channels, including Sites, in surveys, during business or marketing events, and when delivering programs and services to you. When you use the Sites, Otsuka may provide you with opportunities to sign up to receive specific information or services and may ask for your contact information (e.g., name, home address, home phone number or personal email address), so that we can send you specific information about our products, services, educational information and specific health conditions, with your consent. When you enroll in a program that Otsuka offers, we may obtain your contact information, details of your health condition, and prescribing information relating to our products. Otsuka is also obligated to collect certain Personal Information to comply with regulatory requirements, including information relating to adverse effects that you have experienced when using our products. Otsuka may indirectly collect information about your health condition, diagnosis, and treatment from your healthcare professional, but only where your healthcare professional has obtained your consent to disclose that information to us, as required by law. We may collect information from physicians and other healthcare providers who register on our websites in order to verify their licensure status and identity. Otsuka may collect various information from healthcare professionals as part of marketing activities to healthcare professionals, including first name, last name, age, gender, home address, home phone number, medical specialization, professional qualifications, license number and scientific society membership number. As you navigate the Sites, certain passive information may also be collected, including Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, navigational data, the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the browser software you use and your operating system, the date and time you access our Sites, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Sites. This type of information is used for the purposes of gathering data to provide improved administration of our Sites, to improve the quality of your experience when interacting with our Sites, and to show you personalized content. 2.4 Information from External Sources Otsuka may collect information about you from external sources to supplement information provided by you. This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided to Otsuka and to enhance our ability to provide you with information about our business, products, services, and educational information. Otsuka's agreements with these external sources typically limit how the Company may use this supplemental information. 2.5 Research/Survey Solicitations From time to time, Otsuka may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage external service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve Individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products, services, and educational information we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Sites, various types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional activities. If an Individual participates in a survey, the information given will be used along with that of other study participants. We may share de-identified and/or aggregate data for research and analysis purposes. 2.6 How Otsuka Uses Your Personal Information Depending on how you interact with Otsuka, we and our external service providers may also use Personal Information in a variety of ways, including: Providing Information and Services You Requested. Otsuka may use the Personal Information about you to provide you information that you may request, e.g., information about a product or program we are offering.

For example, Otsuka may provide functionality on its Sites that will allow you to forward or disclose certain content with a friend or colleague.

By providing us with the information of another individual, you represent that you have the authority to do so, and permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Pseudonymous Data. Including as discussed below in Section 2.11, Otsuka may use and share your anonymized or de-identified information within the Otsuka group of companies or with external vendors for public health, research, analytics and any other legally permissible purposes. Automated Profiling. We may use technologies considered automated decision making or profiling.

We may also enable you to use these social media resources to post or disclose Personal Information with others. When using social media resources, you should take into careful consideration what Personal Information you disclose to others. If you use online social media resources offered by an external Social Media Resource (\"External SMR\") through the Otsuka Site, you acknowledge that Otsuka may be able to access any information you make public through such External SMR (such as your username, comments, posts and contacts) and other information your privacy settings on such External SMR permit Otsuka to access. Otsuka will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the privacy policies applicable to any External SMR information Otsuka accesses. 2.8 Marketing Communication Individuals who provide us with Personal Information, or whose Personal Information we obtain from external vendors, may receive periodic marketing communications such as emails from us with information on Otsuka or our business partners' products and services or upcoming special offers/events we believe may be of interest. We offer the option to decline or opt out of these communications at no cost to the individual. Disclosure About Direct Marketing for California Residents.

A cookie is set in order to: identify Individuals; tailor our Sites to you; measure and research the effectiveness of our Sites' features, offerings and advertisements; and, authenticate users for registered services. In addition, Otsuka or its external vendors or service providers may collect information from your browser or device for interest-based advertising, using cookies or similar technologies. Cookies can only access Personal Information that you have provided on our Sites and cannot be accessed by other sites. You also have the ability to delete cookie files from your own hard drive at any time by clicking on the Privacy or History tab typically found on the Settings or Options menu in your internet browser. However, please also be advised that cookies may be necessary to provide access to much of the content and many of the features of Otsuka's Sites. To learn more about cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org . 2.9.2 Pixel Tags/Web Beacons Otsuka may use \"pixel tags,\" also known as \"web beacons,\" which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our Sites. A pixel tag can collect information such as: the Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the browser type and language; the device type; geographic location; and, the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, we or our external vendors or service providers may use \"format sensing\" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our email. 2.9.3 Analytics Information We may also use Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Sites, and to develop website content. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ .

We may also share such information we have collected with our advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Otsuka related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as \"interest-based advertising\" or \"online behavioral advertising.\" 2.10 Mobile Devices Otsuka may provide websites and online resources that are specifically designed to be compatible and used on mobile devices. Otsuka will collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use such websites or online resources, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device. Mobile versions of Otsuka's Sites may require that users log in with an account. In such cases, information about use of each mobile version of the website may be associated with user accounts. In addition, Otsuka may enable Individuals to download an application, widget or other tool that can be used on mobile or other computing devices. Some of these tools may store information on mobile or other devices. These tools may transmit Personal Information to Otsuka to enable Individuals to access user accounts and to enable Otsuka to track use of these tools. Some of these tools may enable users to email reports and other information from the tool. Otsuka may use personal or non-identifiable information transmitted to the Company to enhance these tools, to develop new tools, for quality improvement and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or in other notices Otsuka provides. 2.11 De-Identified and Aggregated Information Otsuka may use your Personal Information and other information about you to create de-identified and aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, information about the computer or device from which you access the Otsuka Site or other online services, or other analyses we create. De-identified and aggregated information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of visitors' interest in and use of various portions or features of the Sites. De-identified or aggregated information is not Personal Information, and Otsuka may use such information in a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, analytics and any other legally permissible purposes. We may share this information within Otsuka and with external vendors or service providers for our or their purposes in a de-identified or aggregated form that is designed to prevent anyone from identifying you. We will maintain, maintain, process, and use this data in its deidentified form, and will not attempt to reidentify you from it. 3.0 Choice/Methods to Opt Out You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, as set out in this Privacy Policy. Where you have consented to Otsuka's processing of your Personal Information you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out by following the included opt out instructions. 3.1 Communications An \"Unsubscribe\" option will be provided on certain communications by Otsuka so you can opt out of future communications. However, we may continue to send transaction-related communication regarding products or services you have requested in response to such request. We may need to send you certain communications regarding the Otsuka programs and services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications. 3.2 \"Do Not Track\" Do Not Track (\"DNT\") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected and used over time and across websites or online services. Otsuka recognizes and responds to browser-initiated DNT signals sent by consumers\u2019 devices and browsers. Additional information about how Otsuka responds to certain opt-out preference signals is described in Section 5.1 below. For information about \"do-not-track\", visit http://www.allaboutdnt.org . 3.3 Advertising Choices If you choose to subscribe to any Program(s) through which you provide to us your Personal Information, Otsuka does not sell or share that information with third parties, and such information may not be used by third parties for their own marketing purposes. Otsuka may, however, disclose that information to its corporate affiliates, subsidiaries, vendors, and service providers to provide you with the SMS/text messaging service, to process and respond to your inquiries or requests, to comply with our legal obligations under applicable law, and for any other purpose to which you have consented to. Except as described in the preceding paragraph, Otsuka may use information related to your online browsing activities for interest-based advertising purposes. The online advertising industry provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from participants self-regulatory programs. You can access these websites and learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp , http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ , https://youradchoices.ca/choices/ , and www.aboutads.info/choices/ . To separately make choices for mobile apps on a mobile device, you can download DAA's AppChoices application from your device's app store. Alternatively, for some devices you may use your device's platform controls in your settings to exercise choice. Please note you must separately opt out in each browser and on each device. Advertisements on external websites that contain the AdChoices link may have been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners' use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. Even if you opt-out, we may still collect and use information regarding your browsing activities on our Sites and/or information from the advertisements on external websites for non-interest-based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements. 4.0 Onward Transfer: 4.1 Information We Disclose Otsuka does not sell your Personal Information. Except as provided below, Otsuka does not disclose Personal Information about you absent your consent. Otsuka endeavors to require external vendors or service providers to which it discloses Personal Information to protect Personal Information using substantially-similar standards to those required by Otsuka, and to notify Otsuka if they make a determination they can no longer meet this obligation. 4.1.1 Service Providers Otsuka may share Personal Information with our service providers that we have retained to perform services on our behalf including: (i) provision of IT and related services; (ii) provision of information and services you have requested; (iii) payment processing; and, (iv) customer service activities. Payment information will be used and shared only to effectuate your order and may be stored by a service provider for purposes of future orders. Otsuka executes contracts with service providers prohibiting them from using or sharing your Personal Information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements. 4.1.2 Business Partners Otsuka may disclose Personal Information to our affiliates for our and our affiliates\u2019 internal business purposes or to provide you with a product, service or educational information that you have requested. Otsuka may also provide Personal Information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products, services, or educational information or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. In such cases, our business partner\u2019s name will appear, along with Otsuka\u2019s. Otsuka requires our affiliates and business partners to agree to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was provided. 4.1.3 Information Disclosed to Non-affiliated Parties for Our Protection and the Protection of Others We may disclose information about you to non-affiliated parties: (i) if we are required to do so by law, court order or legal process; (ii) in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (iii) under the discovery process in litigation; (iv) to enforce Otsuka policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to Otsuka; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or, (vii) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes, e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Sites. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared where applicable with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities. 4.1.4 Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions We reserve the right to disclose or transfer any information we have about you in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, any reorganization, sale, lease, merger, joint venture, assignment, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of our business or of any of the business assets or shares (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding). Should such an event occur, Otsuka will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. 4.2 Data Transfers All Personal Information sent or collected via or by Otsuka may be stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, in the United States, in the cloud, our servers, the servers of our affiliates or the servers of our service providers. We will endeavor that any such transfers of Personal Information of an individual residing in the European Union outside of the European Economic Area will only be made where appropriate safeguards have been put in place. Your Personal Information may be accessible to law enforcement or other authorities pursuant to a lawful request. By providing information to Otsuka, you consent to the storage of your Personal Information in these locations. 5.0 Your Privacy Rights We encourage you to update the information you provide to us, such as providing us with a new mailing or email address, a name change, or a change in other material information you have notified us about. This will help us continue to provide information to you that best meets your needs. In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to: (i) request confirmation of whether we are processing Personal Information about you; (ii) obtain access to or a copy of your Personal Information; (iii) receive an electronic copy of Personal Information that you have provided to us, or ask us to send that information to another company (the \"right of data portability\"); (iv) restrict our uses of your Personal Information; (v) seek correction or amendment of inaccurate, untrue, incomplete, or improperly processed Personal Information; (vi) withdraw your consent; and, (vii) request erasure of Personal Information held about you by us, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. If you or your authorized representative would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set forth below. We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws. To protect your privacy, we will take steps to verify your identity, including requiring proof of identity before fulfilling request(s). Although Otsuka makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Otsuka is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others' privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual's privacy in the case in question, or where it is commercially proprietary.

Some integrated advertising or analytics tools (check Section IV to see the list of them) launch automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which means any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests, behavior, location or movements (see the list of data described below). Processing information through automatic data processing technologies starts automatically once you allow our App to track your activity. You can withdraw your permission at any time - please check opt-out options in Section VIII below. We may process some information about your device and your user behaviour on the ground of our legitimate interests. This information falls within categories of data described above in Subsection \u201cInformation That Is Processed Automatically\u201d, it is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual, and we may access it only in aggregated form. We use this information for improving our App and giving our users the best experience. Device Details. When you use a mobile device to access our App, some of the details about your device are reported, including \u201cdevice identifiers\u201d. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device (but not your personality). Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by the third parties. What data can be processed: Information about the device itself: type of your device, type of operating system and its version, model and manufacturer, screen size, screen density, orientation, audio volume and battery, battery life, loading time, latency, framerate, device memory usage. Information about the internet connection: mobile carrier, network provider, network type, IP address, timestamp and duration of sessions, speed, browser. Location-related information: IP address, the country code/ region/ state/ city associated with your SIM card or your device, language setting, time zone, neighboring commercial points of interest (eg. \u201ccoffee shop\u201d). Other device identifiers: e.g. user identifiers (if they are set up by the App\u2019s developer). Information about the applications . Name, API key (identifier for application), version, properties of our App can be reported for automated processing and analysis. Some services also record the list of applications and/or processes which are installed or run on your device. Cookies and similar technologies. When you use the App, cookies and similar technologies may be used (pixels, web beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access the App. The text file is then sent back to the server each time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more effectively. For example, we will know how many users access specific areas or features within our App and which links or ads they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies. Log file information. Log file information is automatically reported each time you make a request to access the App. It can also be provided when the App is installed on your device.

The following data might be reported about the ads you can view: the date and time a particular ad is served; a record if that ad was \u201cclicked\u201d or if it was shown as a \u201cconversion\u201d event; what the ad offer is about; what type of ad it is (e.g., text, image, or video); which ad placement is involved (where the ad offer is displayed within the App); whether you respond to the ad. In-App events. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record in-App information (tutorial steps, levelling up, payments, in-app purchases, custom events, progression events, method of limiting the processing of user data). Information provided automatically to advertising or analytics tools does not generally come to our control, therefore we cannot be responsible for processing such information. Please mind that some services are engaged in personal data profiling and may obtain information related to your personality and/or your device by using technologies that do not belong to our scope of responsibility. In case when your user ID is linked to your Facebook account, Facebook may use your device information in association with categorized data that were already recorded in its databases (eg. your age, gender or other demographic indication). We do not control, supervise or stand surety for how the third parties process your personal data, that might be collected by their own means (not through our App). Any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information should be directed to such third parties (see Section IV). Payment Information Our e-commerce provider is responsible for billing, processing and charging for your purchases, handles your personal information and keeps it absolutely safe and secure. This information is processed as part of the performance of the contract between you and us. We cannot access or use your credit or debit card information.

Responsibility for your data and contact details (1) Responsible person The controller for the processing of your personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR is ONVY HealthTech Group GmbH, Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe 19, 82031 Gr\u00fcnwald, Germany. (2) Contact details You can reach us via email: contact@onvy.health. (3) In particular, you can reach us via these contact details if you wish to assert justified claims against us. (4) If you have any further questions or comments regarding the collection and processing of your personal data, please also use the aforementioned contact details. 2. Definitions Following the example of Art. 4 DS-GVO, this data protection notice is based on the following definitions: - \"Personal data\" (Art. 4 No. 1 DS-GVO) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\"data subject\"). A person is identifiable if he or she can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, an online identifier, location data or by means of information relating to his or her physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity characteristics. The identifiability can also be given by means of a linkage of such information or other additional knowledge. The origin, form or embodiment of the information is irrelevant (photographs, video or sound recordings may also contain personal data). - \"Processing\" (Art. 4 No. 2 GDPR) means any operation which involves the handling of personal data, whether or not by automated (i.e. technology-based) means. This includes, in particular, the collection (i.e., acquisition), recording, organization, arrangement, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment, combination, restriction, erasure or destruction of personal data, as well as the change of a purpose or intended purpose on which a data processing was originally based. - \"Controller\" (Art. 4 No. 7 DS-GVO) means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. - \"Third party\" (Art. 4 No. 10 DS-GVO) means any natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons who, under the direct responsibility of the controller or processor, are authorized to process the personal data; this also includes other group-affiliated legal entities. - \"Processor\" (Art. 4 No. 8 DS-GVO) is a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller, in particular in accordance with the controller's instructions (e.g. IT service provider). In terms of data protection law, a processor is in particular not a third party. - \"Consent\" (Art. 4 No. 11 DS-GVO) of the data subject means any voluntary expression of will in the form of a declaration or other unambiguous affirmative act, given in an informed and unambiguous manner for the specific case, by which the data subject indicates that he or she consents to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. 3. Change of privacy policy / Status (1) In the context of the further development of data protection law as well as technological or organizational changes, our data protection notices are regularly reviewed to determine whether they need to be adapted or supplemented. You will be informed of any changes. (2) This data protection notice is valid as of 26.08.2022. 4. No obligation to provide personal data For you as a user, there is basically no legal or contractual obligation to provide us with your personal data. However, the use of the ONVY app is not possible if you do not provide the necessary data or do not consent to the processing of your personal data. C. Information about the processing of your data 1. The collection of personal data concerning you (1) When you use our app, we collect personal data about you. (2) Personal data is all data that relates to your person (see above under General). For example, your name, your location data, your IP address, the device identifier, the SIM card number, your address and e-mail address are personal data, your fingerprint, images, movies, audio recordings, but also your user behavior falls into this category. 2. Legal bases of data processing (1) In principle, any processing of personal data is prohibited by law and only permitted if the data processing falls under one of the following justifications: - Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a DS-GVO - for health data in conjunction with Art. 9 (2) lit. a DS-GVO (\"consent\"): When the data subject has voluntarily, in an informed manner and unambiguously indicated by a statement or other unambiguous affirmative act that he or she consents to the processing of personal data relating to him or her for one or more specific purposes; - Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. b DS-GVO: If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request; - Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. c DS-GVO: If the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject (e.g. a legal obligation to keep records); - Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. d DS-GVO: If the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person; - Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. e DS-GVO: If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; or - Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f DS-GVO (\"Legitimate Interests\"): If the processing is necessary to protect legitimate (in particular legal or economic) interests of the controller or a third party, unless the conflicting interests or rights of the data subject override (in particular if the data subject is a minor). (2) For the processing operations carried out by us, we indicate below the applicable legal basis in each case. A processing operation may also be based on several legal bases. 3. Data collected during download (1) When downloading this app, certain personal data required for this purpose will be transmitted to the corresponding app store (e.g. Apple App Store or Google Play). (2) In particular, the email address, user name, customer number of the downloading account, individual device identification number, payment information and the time of the download are transmitted to the App Store during the download. (3) We have no influence on the collection and processing of this data; rather, it is carried out exclusively by the App Store selected by you. Accordingly, we are not responsible for this collection and processing; the responsibility for this lies solely with the App Store. 4. Data collected when using the app (1) We can inevitably only provide you with the benefits of our app if we collect and process certain personal data about you that is required for app operation when you use it. When using the app, your personal data and, in some cases, health data are processed. (2) We collect and process the following data from you: - Device information: Access data includes the IP address, device ID, device type, device-specific settings and app settings and app properties, the date and time of the retrieval, time zone, the amount of data transferred and the message whether the data exchange was complete, crash of the app and operating system. This access data is processed to technically enable and improve the operation of the app. - Your email address is required to create your profile on ONVY. The profile is created in the app. Alternatively, you can use the so-called Apple Log-In (\"Log in with Apple\") or the so-called Google Log-In (\u201cLog-in with Google\u201d). Please consult Apple's or Google\u2019s instructions for details: \"Log in with Apple\" & Privacy\" or \u201cHow Sign in with Google helps you share data safely\u201d You can voluntarily enter additional data in your profile such as: First Name, Last Name, Age, Weight, Gender, Height. This improves the function of the app or the calculated scores. - The data from your wearables will be retrieved via Terra as shown in D.5.c. and merged with your profile information by ONVY. - The data from the wearables may allow conclusions to be drawn about your health status and therefore constitute Health Data. - The following data may be sent via Terra to ONVY servers operated exclusively in Germany after your approval for the respective data category (in HealthKit or via the third-party providers such as Strava) and stored and processed there: a. Activities captured by the wearable, such as: - Steps - Minutes of training b. Vital signs data captured by the wearable, such as: - Breathing rate - Heart rate - Sleep duration c. Other data, such as: - Birthday - weight - Height - Ambient noise level - An additional, anonymized data set is generated from your data. This means that the data is completely decoupled from your person, so that it is no longer possible to assign the data to you. As part of the anonymization process, certain data (such as age group or place of residence) are retained in order to allow ONVY to use the data in a meaningful way (e.g. for the development of algorithms). However, this data is so general that it is no longer possible to trace it back to you as an individual person. - Furthermore, we collect anonymized data about the use of the app. In doing so, we record click events, such as the call of a specific page or function. An assignment to the person is not possible here. This data is used for the evaluation of certain functions and the prioritization of further development. (3) The processing of your data is based on your consent given in a separate checkbox in the app to the processing of your data including special categories of personal data (health data) for the purposes mentioned (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a and Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO). 5. Use of cookies We do not use cookies when operating our App. 6. Data collection upon contact (1) If you contact us by e-mail or via a contact form, then your e-mail address, your name and all other personal data that you have provided in the course of contacting us will be stored by us so that we can contact you to answer the question. (2) We delete this data as soon as the storage is no longer necessary. If there are legal retention periods, the data will remain stored, but we will restrict the processing. (3) The processing of the data entered in the contact form or otherwise transmitted when contacting us is based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DS-GVO) in the proper response to the inquiry. 7. product information, newsletter, direct advertising and vouchers (1) We may use the e-mail address you entered when registering in the app or, if you use the Apple Log-In or Google Log-In, the e-mail address transmitted to us by Apple or Google to send you information about the product (e.g. new functionalities) and about our own similar goods and services. You can object to this use of your e-mail address at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates. An informal message by e-mail is sufficient for the objection. Alternatively, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter via the corresponding link contained in each newsletter. The legal basis for the processing of your data within the scope of this paragraph 1 is \u00a7 7 (3) UWG as well as Art. 6 (1) lit. f DS-GVO (our legitimate interest to inform you about the product or about our own similar goods and services). (2) Insofar as you have not objected to the use of your e-mail address, ONVY may send you vouchers to your e-mail address, e.g. to enable you to use the app for an extended period free of charge or to thank you for recommendations of the app. (3) Consequences of unsubscribing from the newsletter or objecting. As soon as you have unsubscribed from our newsletter or objected to the further use of your email address for the purpose of information about our own similar goods and services, your email address will be stored by us or a service provider in a so-called \"blacklist\" to prevent you from receiving further newsletters or information from us. This is done on the basis of our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) in complying with legal requirements when sending newsletters or promotional information. 8. Data storage period (1) We delete your personal data as soon as it is no longer required for the purposes for which we collected or used it. As a rule, we store your personal data for the duration of the usage or contractual relationship via the app. However, storage may take place beyond the specified time in the event of a (threatened) legal dispute with you or other legal proceedings. (2) Third parties used by us will store your data on their system for as long as it is necessary in connection with the provision of the service for us in accordance with the contractual relationship. (3) The data anonymized as described above under C.4.2. will not be deleted, but will be stored and processed by ONVY for an unlimited period of time. (4) Legal requirements for storage and deletion of personal data remain unaffected by the above (e.g. \u00a7 257 HGB or \u00a7 147 AO). If the storage period prescribed by the statutory provisions expires, the personal data will be blocked or deleted unless further storage by us is necessary and there is a legal basis for this. 9. Data security (1) We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction, or against unauthorized access by third parties, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, as well as the existing risks of a data breach (including its likelihood and impact) for the data subject. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments. (2) We restrict access to data transmitted to us to those employees who need access. These employees are contractually obligated to comply with the statutory data protection provisions. (3) In order to protect your data, extensive technical and organizational measures have been implemented (e.g. firewalls, encryption and authentication techniques, procedural instructions). (4) We will gladly provide you with more detailed information on this upon request. 10. No automated decision making (including profiling) We do not intend to use any personal data collected from you for any automated decision-making process (including profiling). 11. Change of purpose (1) Your personal data will only be processed for purposes other than those described if a legal provision permits this or you have consented to the changed purpose of the data processing. (2) In the event of further processing for purposes other than those for which the data was originally collected, we will inform you of these other purposes prior to further processing and provide you with all other relevant information. D. Data processing by third parties / commissioned processing (1) Personal data will be treated by us as strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to third parties, unless specified in the following paragraphs. In particular, no data will be transmitted to analysis services such as Google Analytics or social platforms such as Facebook. (2) We may disclose personal data to government agencies/authorities to the extent necessary to fulfill a legal obligation. The legal basis for the transfer is then Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. c DS-GVO; (3) We may disclose personal data to persons appointed to carry out our business operations (e.g. auditors, banks, insurance companies, legal advisors, supervisory authorities, parties involved in company acquisitions or the establishment of joint ventures). The legal basis for the disclosure is then Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b or lit. f DS-GVO. (4) In addition, we will only disclose your personal data to third parties if you have given your express consent to do so in accordance with Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a DS-GVO. (5) Order data processing (a) It may happen that commissioned service providers are used for individual functions of our app. We use external service providers to process our business transactions (e.g. for the areas of IT, logistics, telecommunications, sales and marketing). They will only act on our instructions and have been contractually obligated within the meaning of Art. 28 DS-GVO to comply with the provisions of data protection law. (b) We currently use the following processors who may have access to your personal data: - Amazon Web Services (IT infrastructure) - Terra ( Terra Enabling Developers, Inc \u2013 see section c). (c) An essential element of the App is the integration of data collected via so-called wearables. For this purpose, ONVY uses Terra as a service provider, which acts as an order data processor for ONVY. The service provider handles the connection and import of activity data from various sources such as fitness wristbands, fitness rings and smartwatches (e.g. Strava, Garmin, Fitbit, Oura, Apple etc. - hereinafter collectively \"Wearables\"). The data may not be retrieved from the provider's server (e.g. Strava), but from the \"Healthkit\" (iOS) or \"Google Fit\" (Android). Apps installed on your mobile device (e.g. the Strava app) write the data to the \"Healthkit\" or \"Google Fit\". ONVY receives a key (so-called token) from Terra to uniquely assign the data retrieved from the different sources to your profile at ONVY. Beyond that, ONVY does not receive any other profile information about the sources from which the data originates; for example, not the email address you use for your user account with the manufacturer of your fitness tracker. Through Terra, the data is retrieved from the connected sources (and approved by you), translated (harmonized) into a standard data format, and transmitted to ONVY. ONVY uses the data to operate the app. For this purpose, the data is also linked with the profile data provided by you (name, e-mail address, etc.) in order to be able to display it meaningfully in the dashboard. From the data, the so-called Onvy Score is determined and displayed in the dashboard. In the process, your recovery values during sleep, your daily exercise, your \"mindfulness\" and your state of stress are converted into a meaningful value (score). In some cases, ONVY transmits pseudonymized (see below for token) profile data (weight, age, gender, height) so that it can be combined with wearables data can be interpreted by Terra using algorithms developed or licensed by Terra and scores (e.g. \"metabolic equivalent\") can be generated. These scores are in turn transmitted to ONVY and ONVY uses them to design the dashboard. Terra cannot associate your data with your person because Terra only knows the key (token), not your name. This means that your name and ONVY profile data are linked to the data from the wearables only by ONVY, not by Terra. E. No transfer of personal data to third countries Your personal data will not be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. to third countries. F. Your rights 1. Right to information (1) You have the right to obtain information about the personal data concerning you within the scope of Art. 15 GDPR. (2) This requires a request from you to be sent either by email or by post to the addresses given above. 2.

We will stop processing your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims. (2) Pursuant to Art. 7(3) DS-GVO, you have the right to revoke your consent once given - i.e. your voluntary will, made understandable in an informed manner and unambiguously by a statement or other unambiguous confirming act, that you agree to the processing of the personal data in question for one or more specific purposes - at any time vis-\u00e0-vis us, if you have given such consent. This has the consequence that we may no longer continue the data processing based on this consent for the future. (3) In this regard, please contact us using the contact details provided above. 3. Right to rectification and cancellation (1) Insofar as personal data concerning you is incorrect, you have the right pursuant to Art. 16 DS-GVO to demand that we correct it without delay. With a request in this regard, please contact us at the contact details provided above. (2) Under the conditions set out in Art. 17 DS-GVO, you have the right to request the deletion of personal data concerning you. With a request in this regard, please contact us at the contact details provided above. In particular, you have the right to erasure if the data in question is no longer necessary for the collection or processing purposes, if the data storage period has expired, if there is an objection, or if there is unlawful processing. 4. Right to restriction of processing (1) In accordance with Art. 18 DS-GVO, you have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data. (2) With a request in this regard, please contact us at the contact details provided above. (3) You are entitled to the right to restrict processing in particular if the accuracy of the personal data is disputed between you and us; in this case, you are entitled to the right for a period of time required to verify the accuracy. The same applies if the successful exercise of a right of objection is still disputed between you and us. You are also entitled to this right in particular if you have a right to erasure and you request restricted processing instead of erasure. 5. Right to data portability (1) Pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, you have the right to receive from us the personal data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, common, machine-readable format. (2) With a request in this regard, please contact the above contact details. 6. Right to complain to the supervisory authority (1) In accordance with Art. 77 GDPR, you have the right to complain about the collection and processing of your personal data to the competent supervisory authority.

If transactions are processed on the Website, transaction information is transmitted to and from the Website in encrypted form using industry-standard SSL connections to help protect such information from interception. We restrict authorized access to your personal information to those persons who have a legitimate purpose to know that information to provide products or services to you and those persons you have authorized to have access to such information. Share follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once Share receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while Share strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We will not sell, distribute, or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. From time to time parts of your information may be processed by a third party; such party shall be obligated to uphold these Policies, to protect the sensitive and personal data of Users of the Platform, in the same proportion, or better manner than Tueetor does. One such party is Stripe \u2013 our payment gateway provider, which you may find its updated Privacy Policy here: https://stripe.com/en-in/privacy-center/legal . The following are a few highlights of the changes it has made as of April 28, 2021: It included a new introduction that provides you more information about Stripe. It updated the policy to remove services that it no longer offers (e.g. Stripe Shop), to remove references to product brands it no longer uses (e.g. Remember Me is now Link with Stripe) and to add more clarity around the descriptions of its services. It added more clarity throughout (and tried to curb the legalese) and added more references to its Privacy Center so you can access more information about its privacy practices. To improve clarity it is providing updated information about the Stripe entities that are responsible for Personal Data under the Privacy Policy. It updated the language around the Privacy Shield for data transfers between EEA and the US and instead refer you to the Privacy Center to learn more about its cross border data transfers. It provided more information about privacy rights that exist in some countries where Stripe offers Services. It has moved the details for its contact information into the Privacy Center.

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. \u200b All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.

We may use your personal data from time to time to contact you (via electronic means) with our internal newsletters and details of new blog posts and other communications or services that we are available on our site or our app, where we think these may be of interest to you. Our emails will contain links which enable you to \u201cunsubscribe\u201d to such communications at any point. Our site and our app may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites. \u200b Information You And We Share \u200b You share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customise, support and market our services. \u200b Information You Share Socially. Our sites and our app allow you to connect and share your actions, comments, content, and information publicly or with friends. Please be mindful of your own privacy needs and the privacy needs of others as you choose whom to connect with and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public or share with others. \u200b For example: When you submit a post or comment to the Services, visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see the content of your posts and comments, the username associated with your posts or comments, and the date and time you originally submitted the post or comment. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., if content you have shared in a one-to-one conversation is shared by another member without your consent) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the services. \u200b When users view your profile, they will be able to see information which you have made public such as your username, age, prior posts and comments, your biography information and how long you have been a member of the Services. \u200b Please note that, even when you delete your account, the posts, comments and messages you submit through the Services may still be viewable or available on our servers. See \u201cManaging and Deleting Your Information\u201d. \u200b Analytics Partners \u200b We may partner with third-party analytics providers to better understand your use of the Services. These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyse usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyse and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services. \u200b Assignment, Change Of Control, And Transfer \u200b All of our rights and obligations under our Privacy Policy are freely assignable by us to any of our affiliates, in connection with a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise, and we may transfer your information to any of our affiliates, successor entities, or new owner. \u200b If TalkLife Ltd or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets; and If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation (including responding to requests from law enforcement authorities both inside and outside the EEA), or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction, and may require us to transfer your personal data outside of the EEA. \u200b How the General Data Protection Regulation Applies To Our Users \u200b The General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679 EU) (EU GDPR) is the governing legislation for collecting and processing personal data in the EU. Following the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020, most of the EU GDPR was retained in UK law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. The retained GDPR is known as the \u201cUK GDPR\u201d. The UK GDPR is supplemented by the Data Protection Act 2018. As a UK based company, all TalkLife activities therefore comply with UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. \u200b Our Legal Bases For Processing Information \u200b We collect, use, and share the information we have described above: \u200b as necessary to fulfil our Terms; consistent with your consent, which you can revoke at any time; as necessary to comply with our legal obligations; occasionally to protect your vital interests, or those of others; as necessary in the public interest; and as necessary for our (or others\u2019) legitimate interests, including our interests in providing an innovative, relevant, safe, and profitable service to our users and partners, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of personal data. \u200b \u200b How You Exercise Your Rights \u200b Under the UK GDPR or other applicable local laws, you have the right to access, rectify, port, erase your information and lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information. This includes the right to object to our processing of your information for direct marketing and the right to object to our processing of your information where we are performing a task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party. You can request at any stage access to information we hold on your account by emailing dpo@talklife.co.You can access tools to rectify, update, and erase your information directly in-app as described in the Managing and Deleting Your Information section. \u200b If we process your information based on our legitimate interests or those of a third party, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing, and we will cease processing your information, unless the processing is based on compelling legitimate grounds or is needed for legal reasons. You can also object to our processing of your information. For marketing communications, we will always seek your opt in consent. Where we use your information for direct marketing for our own Services, you can always object and opt out of future marketing messages using the unsubscribe link in such communications. \u200b \u200b Managing And Deleting Your Information \u200b We store information until it is no longer necessary to provide our services, or until your account is deleted, whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the information, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. \u200b If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your information, we allow you to do that through the following tools: \u200b Services Settings. You can remove posts, comments and photos shared on Vent by using the deletion tool provided on each post, comment or photo. You can also remove posts via your profile and the Previous Posts feature. You can also use our block feature to manage the users with whom you communicate. \u200b Deleting Your Account. You may delete your Vent account at any time (including if you want to revoke your consent to our use of your information) using our in-app delete account feature. When you delete your Vent account, your undelivered messages are deleted from our servers as well as any of your other information we no longer need to operate and provide our Services. Be mindful that if you only delete our Services from your device without using our in-app delete account feature, your information may be stored with us for a longer period. Please remember that when you delete your account, it does not affect the information other users have relating to you, such as their copy of comments, posts or messages that you may have sent to them. We endeavour to remove your information from all of our servers within 14 days of deletion. If you sign into your Vent account at any stage during that period, your account will reactivate and you will need to use our in-app deletion tool again to remove your information. \u200b You may also request the removal or rectification of your details by emailing TalkLife\u2019s Data Protection Officer \u2013 dpo@talklife.co . Please note that we withhold the right to keep a record of any users that have previously been banned from our platform for breaking our terms and conditions if we deem them a future threat to other users. \u200b Our Policies Concerning Minors \u200b Age Requirements. Although we welcome users from all walks of life, Vent is not intended or directed at individuals under the age of 16 years of age. Therefore, individuals under the age of 16 may not create an account. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 and if you are under this age you must not use our Services. Please take your privacy seriously and do not provide false information regarding your age when you register. If we become aware that you are under 16 and using our app or our site, we may terminate your user account and issue bans to your device. \u200b If you are a legal guardian and you have become aware that your Child (\u201ca person under the age of 16\u201d) has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us at dpo@talklife.com .

We may ask you to verify that you are the Child\u2019s legal guardian; however, any requested documentation will be permanently removed from our records once verified. \u200b Law And Protection \u200b We collect, use, preserve, and share your information if we have a good-faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond pursuant to applicable law or regulations, to legal process, or to government requests; (b) enforce our Terms and any other applicable terms and policies, including for investigations of potential violations; (c) detect, investigate, prevent, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our users, TalkLife Limited, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. \u200b Our Global Operations \u200b TalkLife shares information globally, both internally, and externally with our partners and with those you communicate with around the world in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Information controlled by TalkLife Limited is stored in the EU and may be transferred or transmitted to, or processed in the United Kingdom or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the Services set forth in our Terms and globally to operate and provide our Services to you. We utilise standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission, and may rely on adequacy regulations (the UK equivalent to the European Commission\u2019s adequacy decisions) about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers from the United Kingdom to the European Economic Area and other countries. \u200b Changes to our Privacy Policy \u200b This privacy policy is reviewed annually. We will also occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the \u201cLast Updated\u201d date at the top of this Privacy Policy and the revised Privacy Policy will come into effect on the date it was posted to our site or our app or as otherwise notified by us.
